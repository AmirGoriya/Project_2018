Daniel Kaukinen: Project Lead
Tanner van Teeffelen: 1. Radio Scripts - if we don't get anyone to hear about it in the first place, then the entire company is a bust
                      2. HR and Hiring - with this many sections, you'll need someone or a small department to sort through applications and sort out employee issues
                      3. Minor web section developer - maybe not major changes, but little changes here and there to keep it updated
